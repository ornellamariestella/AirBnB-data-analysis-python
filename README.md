## The task

Using Python, I have:

- Loaded the dataset on VS Code
- Inspected and cleaned the data
- Detected and handled outliers
- Explored the data 
- Provided insights supported by the data
- Visualized our findings

## Conclusions

- According to the data, the **most expensive neighbourhood group** based on AirBnB's 2019 listings is **Manhattan** with an average $179 per night, followed by **Brooklyn** and **Staten Island**. **The cheapest** seems to be the **Bronx** with $85 dollars on average.

- By no surprise, **the cheapest neighbourhoods** are located in the Bronx (**Hunts Point, Tremont, Soundview**) where we average around $50 a night only.

- When looking at **room types**, shared rooms are definitely the **cheapest option**, followed by single rooms, and entire apartments. Shared rooms are also the **least popular** room type offered in the City, while it is most common to have an **entire homes** listed by AirBnB hosts. 

- When looking at the **Bronx**, single rooms are the **most popular type of listing** to be found.

- Lastly, with **629 reviews** in 2019 only, Bronx's single *Room near JFK Queen Bed* is the **top reviewed listing** (id 9145202) by host Dona.
